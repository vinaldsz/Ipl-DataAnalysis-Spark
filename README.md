# IPL Data Analysis with Apache Spark

Notebook that includes transformation, SQL analytics and visualisation using Spark on IPL data.

## Project overview
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook(s) demonstrating how to perform ETL (transformations), SQL-style analytics and visualisations on Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data using Apache Spark (PySpark). The notebooks walk through loading raw CSV data, cleaning and transforming it with Spark DataFrame APIs, running analytical queries, and producing visual insights.

## What you'll find here
- Interactive notebooks that use PySpark for scalable data processing.
- Examples of Spark DataFrame transformations and Spark SQL queries.
- Visualisations to help interpret the results (matplotlib / seaborn / plotly examples may be included).
- Guidance to run notebooks locally or on a cloud runtime (e.g., Google Colab).
